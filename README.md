Uniform is a Java library for dealing with HTML forms in web applications.
It integrates in one place:
* Definition of form structure and available data
* Form rendering
* Form data population and extraction
* Form data validation
* Reusable and extensible components

If you are looking for a library similar to PHP's Zend Form but for Java, this one is the perfect fit.

Easy to use with Spring framework + no dependencies!
